This Github Repository is for Learning Embedded Systems , specifically embedded C for AVR microcontrollers 
The Microcontroller (MCU) in use is ATMega32 (which is quite a great start for beginners and is used in many kits). The board in use is AMIT Kit, but Concepts can be used for any Board 
or even separate MCUs.
This Repo aims for the Developer to use Bare-Metal Embedded C for interfacing with the MCU (instead of Standard API of Microchip studio or other Interfacing IDEs)
after each segment, there will be several exercises in separate folders inside each MCAL device for the Developer to practice his gained knowledge throughout their learning Journey.
Mini-projects will follow each set of devices so that the developer can enhance his understanding and grasp deeper Knowledge.
Exercises Simulation was done on Simulide Software which is open-source powerful alternative for Proteus
Recommended Sequence of Learning is as follows:
-DIO ->LED
     ->SSD
     ->LCD
-ADC ->LM35
