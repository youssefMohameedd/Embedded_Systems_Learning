Exercise 0 :
Write SSD Driver using Write_Port functions only (Don't alternate other bits)

Exercise 1: 
Display 1 Digit on 1 SSD with frequency 50 Hz

Exercise 2:
Display Numbers from 0 to 9 with increment every 1 second with frequency of 50 Hz

Exercise 3:
Display 2 Digits on 2 SSDs with Frequency of 25 Hz each

Exercise 4:
Display Numbers from 0 to 99 with increment every 1 second
and Frequency of 25 Hz for each SSD

Exercise 5:
Display predefined number with possibilty to increment or decrement based on
2 Push buttons press action ( PushB0 for increase & PushB1 for decrease) 
with Frequency of 25 Hz for each SSD



 

    uint8 SSD_Value = 12;
	uint8 PushB0_Status = 0;
	uint8 PushB1_Status = 0;

	PushB_Init(PushB0);
	PushB_Init(PushB1);

	SSD_init();


	while(1)
	{	
		if(SSD_Value > 99 ) SSD_Value = 0;
		if(SSD_Value < 0  ) SSD_Value = 99;
		
		if (Debounced_Read_PushB(PushB0) && PushB0_Status == 0)
		{
			SSD_Value++;
			PushB0_Status = 1;
		}
		else if (!Debounced_Read_PushB(PushB0))
		{
			PushB0_Status = 0;
		}

		if (Debounced_Read_PushB(PushB1) && PushB1_Status == 0)
		{
			SSD_Value--;
			PushB1_Status = 1;
		}
		else if (!Debounced_Read_PushB(PushB1))
		{
			PushB1_Status = 0;
		}

		Write_Two_Digits(SSD_Value);
	
	}


Exercise 2 : Adjust SSD Modules to use Write_Ports only instead of Write_Channels
